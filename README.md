# SIMP Processor Simulator

The SIMP Processor Simulator is a simple educational tool that simulates a custom processor. It allows users to write assembly code, assemble it into machine code, and run the instructions through a software-based CPU simulator.

Installation and Setup

1. Build the Assembler and Simulator

To compile the assembler and simulator, run the following commands:

# Build the assembler
cd asm
gcc -o asm main.c

# Build the simulator
cd ../sim
gcc -o sim main.c disk.c execution.c instruction_decode.c instruction_fetch.c interrupts.c io.c memory.c monitor.c registers.c

Usage

1. Running the Simulator with Shell Scripts

Each program directory contains a script to run the simulation. To execute the binomial coefficient program, for example:

cd binom
./run_binom.sh

2. Running Manually via Command Line

If you prefer to manually assemble and run the simulator, follow these steps:

Step 1: Assemble the Program

Navigate to the directory containing the .asm file and run the assembler:

../asm/asm program.asm imemin.txt dmemin.txt

Step 2: Run the Simulator

After assembling, run the simulator with the necessary memory and I/O files:

../sim/sim imemin.txt dmemin.txt diskin.txt irq2in.txt dmemout.txt regout.txt trace.txt hwregtrace.txt cycles.txt leds.txt display7seg.txt diskout.txt monitor.txt monitor.yuv

File Descriptions

File	Description
program.asm	Assembly source code
imemin.txt	Instruction memory input (generated by assembler)
dmemin.txt	Data memory input (generated by assembler)
diskin.txt	Disk input file
irq2in.txt	IRQ2 input file
dmemout.txt	Data memory output after execution
regout.txt	Register values after execution
trace.txt	Execution trace
hwregtrace.txt	Hardware register trace
cycles.txt	Number of execution cycles
leds.txt	LED output trace
display7seg.txt	7-segment display output
diskout.txt	Disk output file
monitor.txt	Monitor output
monitor.yuv	Monitor graphical output in YUV format

Cleaning Up

To remove output files generated during simulation, you can run the following command:

rm *.txt

Troubleshooting
•	If you encounter permission issues, make sure the scripts are executable:

chmod +x binom/run_binom.sh
chmod +x circle/run_circle.sh
chmod +x mulmat/run_mulmat.sh


	•	Ensure you have gcc installed by running:

gcc --version

Future Improvements
•	Additional assembly instructions for enhanced functionality.
•	GUI interface to visualize memory and register values.
•	Performance optimizations.
